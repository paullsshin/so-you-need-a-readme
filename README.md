* The user will need to access the file directly and open their terminal
* Once the terminal has been opened, the user will need to install the necessary items to be able to run the application.
* The user will need to type "npm init -y" and as well as "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" to be able to use the application properly
* Once those packages have been installed, the user can then type "node index.js" to run the application.
* From there, the user will answer all of the prompts and once all of the questions have been answered then a README will be generated for them.
