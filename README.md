## __Usage__ 💻

* It will allow the user to type in anything that they need to do throughout the day.
* The time goes from 0900-1700 hours. Once the time has passed, the time slots will turn gray.
* If the time is current, the time block will be displayed as red.
* If the time block hasn't been reached yet, then it will be displayed as green.
* The user can type in anything they want and then click on the save button to keep their plans saved into local storage so that way if they close their page it will still be there!
